/**
 * Whether a captured memory states an <em>identity</em> fact — who the operator is, who
 * and what they are attached to (JCLAW-529).
 *
 * <p>These are the facts a question reaches for by relation rather than by name ("what do
 * my kids go by?", "where do I live?"), and they are asked often enough that leaving them
 * to retrieval is the wrong trade: measured on a live corpus, the memory holding two
 * children's nicknames scored 0.588 cosine against "what do I call my children?" — below
 * the recall floor, and below an unrelated memory stating the operator's own name. The
 * always-loaded core tier exists for exactly this class, and until JCLAW-529 auto-capture
 * could not put anything in it ({@link MemoryCategory#coerceForCapture} demotes core), so
 * the tier sat empty while the facts it was built for competed for vector-search slots.
 *
 * <p><b>Deterministic, and deliberately not the extractor's opinion.</b> Core memories
 * render above the prompt-cache boundary, so each admission invalidates the cacheable
 * prefix for that agent — the cost JCLAW-981 was protecting against. A model that returns
 * categories outside the closed set it was given (JCLAW-927) is not a safe gate for a
 * tier with that price. The patterns below are a closed list that can be read and argued
 * with; widening it is a code change, not a prompt change.
 *
 * <p>Matches the third-person "The user ..." form {@code EXTRACTION_INSTRUCTIONS} mandates,
 * so a memory written any other way simply does not qualify — failing closed, which for a
 * capped always-loaded tier is the right direction.
