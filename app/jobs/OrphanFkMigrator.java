/**
 * JCLAW-984: constrain a parent reference that shipped as a plain id column, clearing the
 * rows whose parent is already gone so the foreign key can be created at all.
 *
 * <p>Distinct from {@link CascadeFkMigrator}, which converts an <em>existing</em> foreign key
 * to {@code ON DELETE CASCADE}. This one handles the case where no foreign key was ever
 * declared, so nothing stopped the child rows outliving their parent — measured on the
 * reporting instance as 15 of 15 {@code video_generation_job} rows naming a conversation and
 * an attachment that no longer existed.
 *
 * <p>Order is the whole point: adding a foreign key to a populated table fails while an
 * orphan is present, and Hibernate's own {@code hbm2ddl=update} pass runs before any
 * {@code @OnApplicationStart} job can clean up. So its {@code ALTER} loses the race, logs,
 * and leaves the constraint absent — which is exactly the state this class then finds and
 * repairs, within the same boot.
 *
 * <p>Orphans are resolved the way the new constraint would have resolved them: a
 * {@code CASCADE} reference deletes the row, a {@code SET NULL} reference clears the column.
 * That keeps the repair and the rule it installs from ever disagreeing.
