/**
 * JCLAW-529: null supersession pointers whose target row is gone, once per boot.
 *
 * <p>{@code Memory.supersededById} is a bare column with no foreign key — only
 * {@code agent_id} carries one — so before {@link Memory#deleteWithLineage()} every
 * delete could leave retired rows pointing at an id that no longer exists. A live store
 * had 265 of them, each a lineage chain that cannot be walked to its surviving
 * descendant. {@code deleteWithLineage} stops new ones; this repairs the ones already
 * written.
 *
 * <p>Recall never reads the pointer — it filters on {@code supersededAt} — so this fixes
 * an audit question rather than a retrieval one, and is safe to run at any time.
 *
 * <p>Idempotent, and cheap once it has run: the {@code WHERE} matches nothing on a
 * repaired store, so the steady-state cost is one indexed-scan UPDATE per boot. Left in
 * place rather than deleted after one release for the same reason
 * {@link CascadeFkMigrationJob} is — a database restored from an older backup, or a
 * deployment that skipped a version, arrives needing it again.
