/**
 * JCLAW-258: periodic sweep that reconciles RUNNING Tasks whose
 * db-scheduler heartbeat has gone stale to {@link models.Task.Status#LOST}.
 *
 * <p>Runs every 30 s — one full {@code heartbeatInterval} cycle —
 * so a transition from "live" to "stale" is observed within roughly
 * {@code heartbeatInterval + scanInterval = 60 s} after the JVM
 * stops heartbeating. That keeps the operator-visible LOST flip
 * consistently ahead of db-scheduler's own dead-execution detection
 * (which fires at {@code heartbeatInterval × missedHeartbeatsLimit
 * = 120 s}).
 *
 * <p>{@link BootConsistencyCheck#sweep} also calls
 * {@link LostTaskDetector#detect()} once at startup, so a
 * crash-then-restart surfaces LOST tasks within the first sweep
 * rather than waiting up to 30 s for this job's first tick.
