     * Chatterbox against 6-7s warm. In voice mode that cold load lands at or past
     * the client's 60s stall watchdog once STT and generation are added, so the
     * turn is abandoned with no audio and nothing in the server log, because
     * nothing actually failed. Kokoro hides the problem by loading quickly.
     *
     * <p>Warms via a real (tiny) synthesis rather than a load-only worker op, on
     * purpose: engines defer work past model construction. Kokoro installs its
     * spaCy G2P model when the pipeline is first built <em>during synthesis</em> —
     * the JCLAW-859 incident — so a load-only warm would have left exactly that
     * step cold. Warming through the same path the first real request takes is
     * the only way to be sure nothing is left lazy.
     *
     * <p>Detached and best-effort — a model that cannot load is a problem for the
     * request that needs it, not for whoever triggered the warm. The synthesis
     * takes the normal sidecar lock, so a real request arriving mid-warm queues
     * behind it rather than racing, which is the same wait it would have paid
     * loading the model itself.
     *
     * <p><b>Where this is worth calling.</b> Only from a point where no synthesis
     * is already waiting, because the lock is FIFO. Calling it right after a spawn
     * is useless: {@code ensureRunning} is reachable only from inside
     * {@code TtsSidecarClient}'s locked section, so the request that caused the
     * spawn is always ahead of the warm and absorbs the cold load itself. The two
     * useful moments are the operator selecting a model in Settings, and a voice
     * session opening — both leave a gap before anything needs audio.
