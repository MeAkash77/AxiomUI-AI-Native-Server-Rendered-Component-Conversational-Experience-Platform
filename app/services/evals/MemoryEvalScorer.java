/**
 * Scores a {@link MemoryEvalSuite} against retrieval results (JCLAW-529).
 *
 * <p>Pure: the caller supplies each case's ranked retrieval, so scoring is deterministic
 * and testable without a store, an index or a model. The retrieval itself comes from
 * {@code SystemPromptAssembler.recall} (JCLAW-937), which is the same pipeline the system
 * prompt uses — so a score describes production, not a reimplementation of it.
 *
 * <p>Two metrics, because they answer different questions. <b>Recall</b> asks whether the
 * answer was found at all, which is retrieval quality. <b>Coverage</b> asks what fraction
 * of the distinct facts a question needs actually reached the block — which recall
 * structurally cannot see, since a block holding one fact three times and a block holding
 * three different facts score identically on it.
