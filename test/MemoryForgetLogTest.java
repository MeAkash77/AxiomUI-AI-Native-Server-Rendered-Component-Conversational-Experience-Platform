/**
 * JCLAW-971: the forget window is per forgotten fact, not per agent.
 *
 * <p>It used to be a Caffeine {@code expireAfterWrite} entry holding a per-agent list. The
 * list was created once and mutated in place, so Caffeine saw no second write and never
 * refreshed the TTL — every fact an agent forgot inherited the remaining lifetime of the
 * FIRST one. Forget X at 10:00 and Y at 10:09:55 and the whole window evicted five seconds
 * later, so capture re-learned Y on the next turn: the JCLAW-919 failure mode returning
 * non-deterministically near the end of every window.
