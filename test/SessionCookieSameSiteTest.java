/**
 * JCLAW-1025: the session cookie must be {@code SameSite=Strict}.
 *
 * <p>The framework defaults to {@code Lax}, which deliberately attaches the cookie to a
 * cross-site <em>top-level GET navigation</em>. The fork's router then rewrites the request
 * method from an {@code x-http-method-override} query parameter — after the browser has already
 * made its SameSite decision — so a link on an attacker's page can reach a POST-only endpoint
 * carrying the operator's session. Strict withholds the cookie from that navigation.
 *
 * <p>A configuration test on purpose, and the same argument as {@code LogRetentionConfigTest}:
 * whether a browser honours SameSite is the browser's contract, but whether JClaw still asks for
 * Strict is ours, and it is one commented-out line away from silently reverting to the default.
 * PF-170 fixes the override itself in the fork; this is the layer that does not depend on it.
